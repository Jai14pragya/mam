                <strong>Dear Ma'am,</strong> <br><br>
                On this special day, as we celebrate the Father of the Nation, I also celebrate you—someone who, like him, guides and inspires others with wisdom, kindness, and patience. Just as Gandhiji led the country with purpose, you lead us students toward knowledge with unwavering dedication. <br><br>
                Wishing you a birthday filled with joy, good health, and endless smiles. Your sharp wit and banter keep the classroom alive, and we hope it never fades! May you always find reasons to laugh, and may your heart be as light as your spirit is strong. <br><br>
                <strong>Happy Birthday, Ma'am!</strong>
